Convert plain text to unicode with this site. This can be used to 'style' text on apps like iMessage or Google Keep, which do not have bold or italicize options. (**NOTE: Unicode characters cannot be searched through.**) Just enter some text, copy the unicoded result, and paste it into to your app of choice!
